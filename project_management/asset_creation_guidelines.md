# 3D Models

## Format & Style Guidelines
**File Format**: All models exported as `.glb` (GL Transmission Format Binary)  
**Materials**: Solid colors only, following specifications in `project_management/external_palette.md`  
**Texturing**: No complex textures - rely on vertex colors and material properties for visual variety  
**Geometry Style**: Cylinder objects use 8-sided geometry for consistent low-poly aesthetic
